# Coding Challenge Readme

Welcome to the CryptoFi Frontend Engineering coding challenge! This challenge is designed to assess your coding skills, problem-solving abilities, and "grit". Before you begin, please take a moment to read through this readme to understand the challenge requirements, instructions, and guidelines.

## Challenge Description

For this challenge, you will be asked to create an application that allows one of two predefined users to purchase crypto and view their holdings. This app will be written with React and typescript and any other libraries of your choice. This app has been dockerized and will need to communicate with a mock api running locally. Documentation for this can be found at [localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs).

Provided API Endpoints
* `GET /token-prices` - get current list of token prices
* `POST /buy-order` - create a buy order for a user
* `GET /balances` - get a list of balances for a user

### Requirements

1. The App should consist of two pages utilizing react navigation or another similiar software of your choice
1. One page show display the current users crypto holdings
    1. This should show a user's holdings for all tokens returned by the `/token-prices` endpoint
    1. The users return % on each coin should be displayed and recalculated every 5 seconds
1. One page should allow the user to BUY crypto 
    1. Allow buying of any of the tokens returned by the `/token-prices` endpoint `("BTC", "LTC", "BCH", "ETH")`
    2. Allow a user to input the quantity purchased
    3. Current price of the token being purchased for record keeping and return % calculations.
2. Finally this app should allow a user to toggle between two users with `user_id` of `1` or `2` and view/purchase crypto with the selected user
    1. **NOTE** These have been predefined in the api and are the only allowed values for `user_id`


### Evaluation Criteria

Your solution will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

- **Functionality** (:star::star::star::star::star:): Does your code solve the problem as described in the challenge?
- **Code Quality** (:star::star::star::star::star:): Is your code well-organized, readable, and maintainable?
- **State Management** (:star::star::star::star:): How do you choose to handle state management (data, ui, etc).
- **Testing** (:star::star:): Is a complex piece of the application tested? (**Note**: this is more to demonstrate testing abilities, no need to test the entire app)
- **Styling** (:star:): Is the app **minimally styled**? 
- **Documentation** (:star:): Have you provided clear and concise comments where necessary?

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with the challenge:

1. **Clone**: Clone the forked repository to your local machine.
1. **New Private Repo**: Create a new private repo on your personal github account from the cloned coding challenge repo.
1. **Local Environment Setup**:
   - Ensure Docker is installed and running on your machine. For Mac users, the easiest way to do this is by downloading [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
   - Ensure `Make` is installed on your computer. For Mac Users this should already be pre installed
1. **Commands**
   - **Note:** these commands should be run in a terminal window from the root of the project.
   - `make run` - start api
   - `make stop` - stops api and removes database
   - `make destroy` - cleans all unused docker containers from your machine. This should only be used too free up memory post code challenge completion.
1. **Whats Provided**
   - A Dockerized API which will run on [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
   - Autogenerated api docs for testing [localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs)
   - A React Frontend which will run on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Submission Guidelines

To submit your solution, follow these steps:

1. **Commit Changes**: Make sure to commit your code changes locally.
1. **Push to GitHub**: Push your committed changes to your forked repository on GitHub.
1. **Invite Us**: Invite @alexanderlukens, @cooncesean, and @RamseyV to review the repo
1. **Loom Video**: Create a short [loom video](https://www.loom.com/) (5 minutes or less) describing your approach and demoing the coding challenge. 
1. **Email**: Once complete, please reach out to [Becca](mailto:becca@cryptofi.tech) our HR representive with the loom video attached and we will be in touch!
